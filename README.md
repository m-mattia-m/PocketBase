# PocketBase

Due to the fact that [PocketBase](https://arc.net/l/quote/sjkguvqg) does not provide an own Docker image, I created this
repository to provide myself one. If you want, you can also use it. I try to keep it up to date, although I can not
promise something. However, I use this image for my own projects, so it probably will be more or less up-to-date.
